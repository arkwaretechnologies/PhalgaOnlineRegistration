## Logo Files

Place your PHALGA logo image files here:

- **`left.png`** - Logo for the left side of the header
- **`right.png`** - Logo for the right side of the header

### Logo Specifications:
- **For sharp display on all screens (including retina):** use at least **256×256 px** (or 128×128 minimum). Low-resolution images will look pixelated.
- Width/height: Square or any aspect ratio (display area is 40px on mobile, 64px on desktop; `object-cover` is used).
- Supported formats: PNG (recommended for logos).
- Files are served unoptimized so full resolution is used for quality.

The logos will appear on either side of the "PHALGA Registration Form" title in the header.
